# Polyline Editor (C++ / ImGui / OpenGL)

This project is a simple **polyline editor** written in **C++**, using the following libraries:

- [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) – for GUI rendering
- [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) – for graphics rendering
- [GLAD](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) – for managing OpenGL function pointers

The application allows users to create and manipulate polylines in a graphical interface.
